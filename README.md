# I2C-9555
## License: CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2


A compliment to the [I2C-8574](/pages/I2C-8574.html) dual 8-bit board, the 9555 offers a 16 bit data path (2x 8-bit ports, port0 and port1)
This board is slightly cheaper to build (1x 9555 chip -vs- 2x 8574 chips...), but slightly harder to use (unpacking 16 bit words into byte size chunks)
